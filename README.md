# Blanchard

[Demo](https://dzianachayeuskaya.github.io/Blanchard).

This project presents a semantic, flexbox layout, without the use of frameworks. All content is available in both portrait and landscape modes (adaptivity with a minimum of media queries is implemented). In each browser, an absolutely identical layout opens (cross-browser functionality is implemented). During creation, BEM class naming was used.
In the "Gallery" block, viewing various paintings is possible by clicking on the "forward"/"backward" arrows located at the top of the block above the paintings, as well as by holding down the click directly on any of the paintings and simultaneously scrolling right/left.
When you click on the second painting (“Woman with a rake” in the “Gallery” block), a modal window opens with a detailed description of the painting.
This project is also very interactive.
